# product-dev

This repo includes a series of Ansible tasks to make myself more _product-dev_,
and get a full DE computer set up in seconds.

It is currently being developed and tested with Ubuntu, MacOS will be added in next.

This is heavily inspired by [ThePrimeagen](https://twitch.tv/theprimeagen).
